1.2: Are some cities more windy than others? Does Chicago deserve to be nicknamed “The Windy City”? Given below are the average wind speeds (in miles per hour) for 45 selected U.S. cities:

8.9 12.4 8.6 11.3 9.2 8.8 35.1 6.2 7.0
7.1 11.8 10.7 7.6 9.1 9.2 8.2 9.0 8.7
9.1 10.9 10.3 9.6 7.8 11.5 9.3 7.9 8.8

a) Construct a relative frequency histogram for these data. (Choose the class boundaries without including the value 35.1 in the range of values.)
b) The value 35.1 was recorded at Mt. Washington, New Hampshire. Does the geography of that city explain the magnitude of its average wind speed?
c) The average wind speed for Chicago is 10.3 miles per hour. What percentage of the cities have average wind speeds in excess of Chicago’s?
d) Do you think that Chicago is unusually windy?
